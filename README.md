Mail Server
===========

Thanks for using the totally secure Mail Server
from your friends here at TotallyIneptSecurity, Inc.

Created under the premise of providing un-hackable,
un-breakable, un-ssh-able, and un-everythin-able email
servers, Mail Server provides an easy-to-manage
file structure. Best of all, Mail Server complies with
TotallyIneptSecurity, Inc's rigorous audit policies;
because as we say here at TotallyIneptSecurity:
  "The best security is the kind you can easily audit"

## Auditing Electronic User Correspondence

To audit a specific employee's inbox, simply navigate
to the `emails` directory from the root of the main 
mail server directory.

Inside of the `emails` directory, you will see a
directory containing email messages for each user.

Because we champion security through encryption here
at TotallyIneptSecurity, inc, we make it easy for
our email clients to encrypt messages using an
email recipient's **public GPG key (gpg)**.

To provide this ease-of-use feature to all of our
email clients, our server stores all employee public
public keys in an easy-to-access directory labelled
`pub_keys`.

## Auditing User Attachments

Because correspondence between users sometimes contains
attached files, we make it easy to audit that
information as well by storing it in a convenient
location labelled `attachments`. This contains all
attached files sent by all users through messages stored
in our email server.

Because we also value the privacy of our employees (and
anyone in general using our products (tm)), attachments
are not grouped by a particular user, or linked to them
in any way. All attachments are simply dumped into that
one single location, free to be audited, but not traced
back to an individual user (tm).

And your auditors happy" (tm).

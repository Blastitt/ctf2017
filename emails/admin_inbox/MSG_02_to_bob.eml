Bob,

After a recent internal audit, our records indicate
that we do not yet have a copy of your private GPG
key.

Internal company policy requires us to have access to
every employee's records -- this includes potentially
encrypted email messages created by an employee
themselves.

Because we believe in putting security above all else
here at TotallyIneptSecurity, I am attaching an
executable program (made by our very own security
experts at the company) that you can use to
obfuscate your private key before attaching it in a
reply email to me.

The program's name is `cryptonite` and you will be able
to find it in your attachments.

I am also attaching a copy of my public GPG key
(don't worry, I am told those are safe to share as
plaintext).

To use `cryptonite`, simply execute the program,
passing the path to your private key as the first parameter
and the path to my downloaded public key as the second
parameter. This is completely safe and the operation cannot
be reversed easily, at all. I have included an example below
that shows how to obfuscate your private GPG key with
`cryptnoite`.


Using Cryptonite (c):
--------
$ ./cryptonite /path/to/your/privkey /path/to/my/pubkey
